## Experimental personal project for setting up reminders on my machine
This is a simple app for managing reminders on my local machine. It's currently in a console app. I've separated the UI, input and output, data access, entities, and business logic. I am using TDD for the development.
## Updates
### 3/6/2023: 
Initial checkin to Git. A vertical slice is working, to save a reminder to storage.
